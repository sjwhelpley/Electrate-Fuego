  <!--
    Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – 
    for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical 
    Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science 
    and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool 
    web document that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how 
    different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, 
    and also contribute to where you might be going. 
    
    In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, 
    and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community 
    and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps 
    makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. 
    Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

    You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: 
    https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these 
    tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present 
    yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want 
    to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they 
    work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about 
    computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

    So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, 
    tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document 
    that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed 
    in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who 
    helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get 
    started?

    To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. 
    If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. 
    But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). 
    Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your 
    other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or 
    "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started 
    building our own electrate experience.

  <!--
    BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, 
    absent from the larger design.
  -->

  <!--
    First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed 
    to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, 
    from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab.

    <!-- 
      We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your 
      style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a 
      "Wide Image." Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your 
      life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and 
      over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition 
      to establish a motif in this web document.  

      Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to 
      do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to 
      match you image asset.

      Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not 
      majoring in "electracy".

      In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our 
      field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or 
      profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think 
      more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger 
      significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to 
      those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or

      <h2>For my future career, I desire to be a web developer. This involves building the many components that dictate
        a user's experience on the Internet, from visual appearence to functionality to data storage. Web development
        has always appealled to me since I first got the chance to create websites in high school because of the intersection of
        creativity and technicality. Building websites allows me to have an active role in both coding and designing. I also admire
        what websites offer each and every person. Whether it be businesses, events, or individuals, web pages can be highly 
        beneficial for awareness and engagement. My goal is to work in a small web design agency so that I will be able to interact 
        with a lot of different people and projects. I want to help people get the online presence they want that might not have 
        access to the skills or time to do so themself.

        with them these last 6 months than I originally thought I would. We got each other through classes, work and 
        overall tough times. While my permanent home is in Ohio with my family, my home in Pittsburgh is a newer one. 
        I recently moved in with 5 other girls for this upcoming year, and it has definitely been a nice home away from

      Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird,
      but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you 
      language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some 
      time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media 
      content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add 
      elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't 
      break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z...

      FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," 
      developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always 
      improve upon "Lorem ipsum."

      <h2>From a young age, I watched Doctor Who with my dad and brother, which also led me to watch other sci-fi and action movies/shows with them. 
        Those forms of entertainment have played a huge role in my life and what I am now interested in watching. My tastes have changed a lot but I can't 
        avoid the importance they had early on. It was also a very social experience whether that be with family, friends, or following fandom accounts on Intagram.
        
        <br><br>

        Music is also pretty important with how I entertain myself. I definitely do not listen to music as much as a lot of people I know -
        because I tend to desire quiet spaces - but when I do want to listen, I tend to make it a full experience, where I just sit and focus on
        the music itself. My music taste isn't very broad, but I have evolved and discovered new things I like over the years. The ability to use Spotify
        to listen to whatever I want is so different from my middle school experience of trying to get a radio signal on my MP3 player to listen to whatever I could.

        I do not know where I would be today without this educational experience. Outside of the classroom, I've had to 
        learn a lot about meeting new people and living in a different state.

        Last summer, I had the chance to study abroad in Cape Town, South Africa and that was also an era of my schooling

        course I took helped me determine what I truly wanted to do after graduation. I also made a lot of connections with friends
